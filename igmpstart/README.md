Panasonic HC-V520 remote control and stream enabler.

Used to stream camcorder video via wifi directly to the internet.
(for this performance: http://www.naprave.net/en/services/31/generalka-za-generacijo/)

It finds cameras on the current network and starts/stop streaming of video.

This was handled by ffserver, but the main.cpp contains code that shows you how to save the data.
